# Hookshot (oot-recomp)

**Hookshot** is the port's name (as Skybound is TOTKPort's and BlueShell is mkw-recomp's); the maintainer's repository
folder stays `oot-recomp`. The game builds as `hookshot.exe` + `hookshot_vk.dll` (`hookshot` + `hookshot_vk.so` on Linux).

A static recompilation of the Switch 2 *The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time* remake to native x86-64 Windows and Linux:
the game's code lifted to C (NotRexed's a64-kit, Rexcomp's AArch64 kit), the Horizon OS and NVN2 implemented
natively, the GPU work replayed on Vulkan. It is a fork of mkw-recomp (`..\mkw-recomp`, Mario Kart World), whose
paths it keeps so MKW's fixes apply here.

**No game files are in this repository.** The dump is read where it lies (`work/dump.txt`); everything made from it
(modules, image, lifted C, builds, runs) goes to `work/`, which git ignores.

Status: the game plays; the README's [status table](../readme.md#project-status) says how far. The design, its stages and
the lessons carried over from MKW: [design.md](design.md).

## Use

Requirements: Python 3 with `pip install -r requirements.txt` (`lz4`, `numpy`, `capstone`, `unicorn` 2.1,
`zstandard`, and the button-prompt packages); a compiler: on Windows llvm-mingw
(`HOOKSHOT_MINGW`, or an `llvm-mingw` folder in the clone), else emsdk's clang at `C:\emsdk` (or `EMSDK`) with Visual
Studio's C++ tools; on Linux clang and lld. For the Vulkan back end: distro Vulkan / SPIR-V / VMA headers under
`/usr`, or `HOOKSHOT_VULKAN_HEADERS` / `HOOKSHOT_SPIRV_HEADERS` / `HOOKSHOT_VMA_HEADERS`, or a CPM package cache
(`RX_CPM`, else `cpm` in the clone, else the old caches in mkw-recomp's `work/eg` or `..\Eglantine\.cache\cpm`).
Without those the standalone build stops. [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#development-setup) has the rest.

On Linux, `make_game.py` checks the mandatory Python modules, compilers/linker, renderer headers and FFmpeg
development libraries before reading or translating the dump, and lists every missing prerequisite in one error.
It uses the compile's lookup order: CPM caches first, then `HOOKSHOT_*_HEADERS`, then `/usr/local` and `/usr`;
FFmpeg comes from `HOOKSHOT_FFMPEG` when it holds `lib/libavcodec.a`, otherwise from `pkg-config`. The C probe
uses the selected compiler, lld and `HOOKSHOT_SYSROOT` if set. A prebuilt renderer does not need renderer headers
unless an NGX SDK selects a source renderer instead; source builds still need clang++ for the native translator.
The AppImage uses its bundled tools,
and `RX_TARGET=windows` keeps the Windows toolchain checks rather than requiring Linux development libraries.
The button-prompt packages in `nx2/prompt_requirements.txt` remain optional; this check installs nothing.

Run everything with `python -I` from this folder.

| Command | What |
|---|---|
| `python -I nx2/nup.py <file.nup> --extract work/dump` | the `.nup` dump package to `work/dump/exefs` + `romfs` (newest title; ZBIC NSOs made plain by `nx2/unpack.py`) |
| `python -I nx2/dump.py --dump <folder with exefs/ and romfs/> --set` | what the dump is (Switch 1 or 2, ids, modules, SDK, NVN); `--set` records it in `work/dump.txt` |
| `python -I nx2/lift.py [--write]` | image + discovery + coverage (`work/image/coverage.txt`); `--write` emits the C to `work/gen` |
| `python -I nx2/census.py --nx2` | instruction census per module, after the Switch 2 forms |
| `python -I nx2/test_insn.py [--per 6 --states 12]` | every instruction form the game uses, Unicorn vs lifted C |
| `python -I nx2/test_leaf.py [--count 3000 --states 4] [--calls]` | random whole functions (or call trees), Unicorn vs recompiled native code on the real image |
| `python -I nx2/lift.py --standalone --write` then `python -I nx2/build.py --standalone --jobs 4` | the standalone game: `work/sa/build/hookshot.exe` + `hookshot_vk.dll` |
| `powershell -File scripts/run-vk.ps1 [-Window] [-Seconds 120] [-Name x]` | a muted test run on Vulkan, with screenshots in `work/runs/<name>/shots` |
| `python -I scripts/prof.py <stacks file>` | a profile sampled with `HOS_PROFILE=<seconds>` + `HOS_SAMPLE=<thread>` + `HOS_SAMPLE_FILE=<stacks file>` (the sampler runs only with `HOS_PROFILE` set), named from the linker maps |

The dump can also come from `OOT_DUMP` (its folder) or `OOT_EXEFS`; `OOT_WORK` moves the work folder.

The built game's own arguments (`image.bin`, `--romfs`, `--user`, `--trace`, `--prepare-shaders`) are in the README's
[Running the game from the command line](../readme.md#running-the-game-from-the-command-line).

Scripted test input (`HOS_INPUT_SCRIPT` and `HOS_INPUT_LIVE`) is applied before the window-focus check. A log saying
the game window is not in front does not mean those presses were discarded. `HOS_HEADLESS` and
`HOS_WINDOW_NOACTIVATE` change window creation, not this input routing. The game must still reach a state that reads
and responds to the supplied controller input.

Physical keyboard and mouse input stays with the foreground window. Physical controllers can also play in the
background when the existing "Controller in background" option or `HOS_INPUT_BACKGROUND=1` enables them;
`HOS_INPUT_BACKGROUND=0` overrides that option. With `HOS_INPUT_EXCLUSIVE=1` the script
alone drives the game until 5 s after its last press; without it the player's devices add to the script's presses. It
is not a focus override.

When an SDL controller connects, its `hid: controller` log line includes the hardware `guid` and active
`mapping-name` (names are limited to 128 bytes). The `mapping-string` follows in GUID-labelled parts of at most
512 bytes, up to 1024 bytes in total, with a note when truncated. The GUID and mapping describe a device model's
button layout; no serial, path, user or account call is made. A mapping the player supplied himself, by environment
or file, is logged as he wrote it, within those limits.
`mapping=available` means SDL returned a mapping, not that its origin is known; `mapping=none` means SDL returned
none, and `unavailable` means the loaded SDL lacks a required diagnostic call. A zero GUID is `unknown`.
These queries do not change bindings, load a mapping file, or change which controllers are read.

## Switches for testing and debugging

The running game reads its switches from the environment or from `hookshot_env.txt` beside `image.bin` (one
`NAME=VALUE` a line, `#` for notes; `HOS_ENV_FILE=<path>` reads that file instead). The environment goes first: a name
already set when the game starts keeps its value and the file's line for it is left out (the log says so). A switch
that stands in for a menu row lasts for its run; the options file keeps the player's value (`env_override` in
`gpu/vk/vk_menu.cpp`). Switches the shader translation reads are part of the program cache's stamp
(`disk_stamp` in `gpu/vk/vk_shader.cpp`; `tests/test_program_stamp_knobs.py` checks the translator's). The build reads its own from the
environment. The README has the ones players are asked to try (`RX_VK_ASTC_RGBA8`, `RX_VK_LOW_SPEC`,
`RX_VK_MOVIE_UPSCALE`, `RX_VK_SKIP_CODE`, `HOS_OOT_CHEATS`). There are several hundred more, most of them one-off
experiments: `grep -rnE '(getenv|env_on)\("' host gpu/vk` lists them, and the comment where each is read says what it
does. An on/off switch ("(set)" below) is on for `1` or any other value, and off when it is unset, empty, `0`, `false`,
`off` or `no` (`env_on` in `gpu/vk/compat/hookshot_env.h`, `kit.env_on` in Python); it used to be that any value turned
one on, `0` included. A switch that takes a number or a list reads its value as it says.

`RX_VK_MESH_NOCULL=<prefix,...>` turns off the culling in the task shaders whose native code key starts with one of
the prefixes. On a Steam Deck, `RX_VK_MESH_NOCULL=2c56dc1006942f74` avoids the same hang without leaving anything out:
that task shader walks a coarse depth grid cell by cell for every meshlet and ends with
`visible = (result & 1) | (c3[2320] & 4)`, bit 4 being the game's own "draw everything". The switch makes that answer
true, and dead code elimination removes the grid walk, so every meshlet is drawn and the rasterizer clips what is off
screen. It costs some GPU time on cards that cull quickly, so it is off unless set. The log says
"culling off, every meshlet drawn" for each task shader it changed.

### Running a test

| Switch | What it does |
|---|---|
| `HOS_HEADLESS` (set) | No window: the renderer draws offscreen, for screenshots and frame dumps. The menu's Save my pipeline list then opens nothing (no browser, folder or clipboard) |
| `HOS_WINDOW_SIZE=<w>x<h>` | The window's size in pixels (1280x720 by default, wider for an ultrawide picture) |
| `HOS_WINDOW_NOACTIVATE` (set) | The window opens behind the others and does not take the focus (Windows) |
| `HOS_FULLSCREEN=1` | Starts in fullscreen; the Insert menu's Fullscreen row is then left alone |
| `HOS_AUDIO=0` | No sound device is opened (the mixer still runs); `scripts/run-vk.ps1` sets it unless `-Sound` |
| `HOS_LANGUAGE=<code>` | The game's language for this run, a code from `language.txt` |
| `HOS_OUTPUT_RES=<width>x<height>`, `HOS_HANDHELD=1`, `HOS_ASPECT=<ratio>` | Over the options file: the output resolution (a size, as `output_res`), the handheld profile, a picture wider than 16:9 (2.3889 for 3440x1440) |
| `HOS_DISPLAY_MODES=<w>x<h>,<w>x<h>,...` | The screen's display modes for this run, in place of Windows' (`gpu/vk/display_modes.h`): the Insert menu's Aspect ratio and Output resolution rows offer these sizes and the common sizes of their shapes (`display_modes.h` `common_sizes`), for checking a screen you do not have |
| `HOS_WIDE_MAX_PX=<pixels>` | The most pixels a picture wider or narrower than 16:9 takes (`host/hos_wide_size.h`): 5120x2160's by default; 8294400 is 3840x2160's, the cap before |
| `HOS_DYNRES=0`, `HOS_REALTIME_STEP=0`, `HOS_TEXT_SPEED=<0..3>` | Over the options file: Resolution 100% (non-zero: Auto), Game speed Per frame (1: Real time), Text speed |
| `RX_VK_FRAMEGEN=0`, `RX_VK_FRAMEGEN_MULT=<2..8>`, `RX_VK_PACE=0`, `RX_VK_UPSCALE=<0..2>` | No frame generation whatever the menu says; over the options file: its multiplier, frame pacing, the upscaling filter |
| `RX_VK_DEVICE=<n>` | The graphics card listed as `vk: device <n>` in the log, over the menu's GPU device |
| `HOOKSHOT_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` | No look for a newer release at the start |
| `HOS_TRACE=1` | Every Horizon call logged, as `--trace` does |
| `RX_BACKEND=<name>` | Unset or `vulkan`: `hookshot_vk.dll`; any other value: the WebGPU renderer, when the exe was built with one |
| `HOS_GPU_ALLOC_RETRY=0` | A model's material-block allocations from a full heap (the OptimizeChangeBank thread's two CPU buffers and two GPU-memory calls in f_804566e0) not tried in the heap's parents, as shipped (`host/oot_heap_retry.c`, issue 1697) |
| `HOS_GPU_ALLOC_TEST_FAIL=<n>` or `<gpu>,<cpu>` | A test: the first n of those allocations of each kind (or that many of the GPU memory and of the CPU buffers) refused by the heap they name, as a full heap would, so the retry runs |

### Input for scripted runs

| Switch | What it does |
|---|---|
| `HOS_INPUT_SCRIPT=<presses>` | Presses timed from the game's first controller read |
| `HOS_INPUT_LIVE=<file>` | A file the test appends lines of presses to, read every 30 ms; each line's times count from when it is read. A line `!cheat <n>` sends a Cheats page action, `!synclog` logs the NVN syncs (`!dump`, `!shots`, `!rdoc` and `!flasharm` are the WebGPU renderer's) |
| `HOS_INPUT_FRAME_CLOCK=1` | The script's time runs at 60 game frames a second instead of the wall clock |
| `HOS_INPUT_EXCLUSIVE`, `HOS_INPUT_BACKGROUND`, `HOS_INPUT_SCRIPT_BACKGROUND` (set) | As above; the last lets every device count while the window is behind another one |
| `RX_VK_MENU_SCRIPT=<seconds>:<key>,...` | Timed Insert menu keys: `INS`, `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `ESC`, `ENTER`, `TABL`, `TABR` |
| `RX_VK_UI_PROMPTS=pad` or `keys` | The menu's button prompts for a controller or the keys, whatever was used last (screenshots) |
| `RX_VK_UI_GAME_FONT=0` | The menu, the counter and the start-up screen in the included Libertinus, not the game's own font |

The presses are `<seconds>:<button>[+<button>...][/<ms>]`, separated by commas, for example `2:A,5.5:LUP/1500,9:ZL+R`.
The buttons are `A B X Y L R ZL ZR PLUS MINUS LS RS LEFT UP RIGHT DOWN`, and the sticks pushed to their edge `LUP
LDOWN LLEFT LRIGHT RUP RDOWN RLEFT RRIGHT`. A press is held for 200 ms unless `/<ms>` says otherwise. The names are
case-sensitive, and an unknown one is ignored.

### Pictures and frames

| Switch | What it does |
|---|---|
| `RX_VK_SHOTS=<dir>` | A PNG every `RX_VK_SHOT_EVERY` presents (300) as `vk_<present>.png`, at `RX_VK_SHOT_W` x `RX_VK_SHOT_H` (1280x720) |
| `RX_VK_FLASH=1` | The flash detector, with `RX_VK_SHOTS` and `RX_VK_SHOT_EVERY=1`: writes the frames around a flash and dumps the next one |
| `RX_VK_FRAMELOG=<file>` | Every frame shown, as pictures at 320x180, while `<file>.go` exists; `python -I scripts/framelog.py <file>` finds the flashes. Not `RX_VK_FRAME_LOG` (with the underscore: frame times, below) |
| `RX_VK_DUMP=<present>[+<count>][,...]` | Every step of the frame after that present as PNGs, in `dump_<present>` under `RX_VK_DUMP_DIR` (or `RX_VK_SHOTS`, or the current folder); `RX_VK_DUMP_STEPS=<lo>-<hi>` and `RX_VK_DUMP_PROGS=<key>,...` narrow it |
| `RX_VK_PASS_TRACE=1` | The passes of the last frames, logged at a flash or a dark frame (`RX_VK_PASS_TRACE_AT=<n>`: every n-th present) |
| `RX_VK_PROBE=1` or `2` | The centre texel after every pass: `probe_<frame>.txt` at a flash (1), or `probe_all_<n>.txt` at speed (2); `python -I scripts/probe.py` reads them |
| `RX_VK_DUMP_FAILED=<dir>` | The native code of every program that does not translate, for `nx2/lower_test.py` (game data: keep it local) |

### Time and profiles

| Switch | What it does |
|---|---|
| `HOS_PROFILE=<seconds>` | Every interval, the busiest threads in the log; it also starts the samplers below |
| `HOS_SAMPLE=<thread>` + `HOS_SAMPLE_FILE=<file>` | One thread's stacks, sampled every millisecond (needs `HOS_PROFILE`); `python -I scripts/prof.py <file>` reads them |
| `HOS_SAMPLE_ALL=<file>` | Every game and renderer thread every 2 ms while `<file>.go` exists (needs `HOS_PROFILE`); `scripts/crit.py`, `scripts/vkprof.py`, `scripts/hotlist.py` and `scripts/cpu_report.py` (the [CPU profile](cpu-profile.md): CPU time by category, thread and function, and what limits the frame) read it (on Linux with `RX_MAPS=<game folder>`: they name frames from its `hookshot` and `hookshot_vk.so`) |
| `HOS_CHAIN=<file>` | While `<file>.go` exists, every wait of a game thread that blocks, every signal that can end one, every sleep and every present, with the time, the thread, the object and the caller; written to `<file>` when `<file>.go` goes away (about 2 million records at most). `python -I scripts/chain.py <file> [<HOS_SAMPLE_ALL file>]` walks each frame back from its present (the thread that ran, the wait that stopped it, the thread whose signal ended it) and prints the frame's critical path by thread: running, wake-ups, sleeps, and, with a sample file of the same run, the functions on it |
| `HOS_THREAD_TIMES=<seconds>` | Every interval, the threads that used over 5% of a core |
| `HOS_FPS_LOG` (set), `HOS_PRESENT_TRACE=<csv>` | The game's frame limiter, VRR flags and nominal rate every 300 presents, and the game clock's speed (1.000: real time); a CSV line per game present with host-clock times before queue flushing, around the renderer call, after virtual-core reacquisition, and at the return counter. These are CPU wall times, not GPU completion or scanout; async rendering measures the enqueue call. Unset/empty trace adds no clock reads |
| `HOS_FPS_MAX=<61-1000>` | A frame rate cap for one run, over the Game frame rate cap row (1000 is Uncapped's) |
| `RX_VK_FRAME_LOG=<csv>` | A CSV line per present: frame, seconds, frame time in ms. Also works with `HOS_HEADLESS`: CPU intervals after submitting the offscreen copy, without swapchain/display waits. Not `RX_VK_FRAMELOG` (no underscore: pictures, above) |
| `RX_VK_PRESENTS_AHEAD=<1-8>` | How many presents the game may hand over ahead of the replay (2). Not `RX_VK_PRESENT_AHEAD` |
| `RX_VK_PRESENT_AHEAD=0` | Frame generation's copies into the window submitted each at its own time, as before #1702 (default on: a set's copies go to the GPU together). Not `RX_VK_PRESENTS_AHEAD` |
| `RX_VK_PASS_TIMING=1` or `2` | GPU time per pass (2: per program too), logged every 600 presents |
| `RX_VK_SLOW_LOG=<ms>` | The replay's times for each frame that took longer than this |
| `RX_VK_LOG_PROGRAM_LIFE=1` | The programs' life: a log line at each program the game makes (its shaders set) or frees and at each program's first draw or dispatch (what it needed: a program read from the cache, a translation, a pipeline from a cache or compiled, left out, and how long after its create call), and a `program census` line every 600 presents |
| `RX_VK_PRESENT_THREAD=1` | On (off by default: the game's thread presents). Where the device has a second queue that can present to the window (a second queue of the replay's family, else a compute family's): each present is made on a thread and queue of its own once the frame's copy into the window is done, and the game's thread goes on at once (with NVIDIA's driver on Wayland the present otherwise waits ~2.4 ms a frame for the GPU there). One present out at most; under V-Sync On (FIFO) with `VK_KHR_present_wait`, until it is shown. The log has the fence's and the present's time (and how long after it the frame was shown) every 600 presents |
| `HOS_PGO=<file>` | In a run of an `RX_PGO=gen` build: `<file>.reset` clears the counters, `<file>.dump` writes them to `<file>`. It is read before `hookshot_env.txt`, so set it in the environment |

### The GPU

Pipeline-cache file ownership, temporary storage and failure behavior are described in
[pipeline cache storage](pipeline-cache-storage.md).

| Switch | What it does |
|---|---|
| `RX_VK_VALIDATION` (set) | The Khronos validation layer |
| `RX_VK_CHECKPOINTS=0` | No NVIDIA checkpoints (on by default; after a lost device they name the draw it stopped at) |
| `RX_VK_HANG_DUMP=<file>` | Every thread's stack to the file once no frame was shown for `RX_VK_HANG_SEC` seconds (20) (Windows) |
| `RX_VK_GPU_HANG_SEC=<s>` | Work sent to the GPU that finishes nothing for this long (30) is a hang: the lost-device report, then the game ends. `0`: the stall is logged and the game waits |
| `RX_VK_NOOPT` (set) | Pipelines built without the driver's optimisations |
| `RX_VK_SKIP_PROG=<prefix>,...` | Leaves out the draws of these programs (default `53509044401d78d2`; `-` leaves out none) |
| `RX_VK_PIPE_SKIP=0`, `1` or `2` | Default/`1`: wait for shader translation (with `RX_VK_TRANSLATE_WAIT_MS` set, a draw whose targets hold an earlier frame waits at most that long a frame in all, then is left out). A pending pipeline can be skipped only for attachment-only draws whose targets hold an earlier frame. `0`: wait for every translation and pipeline. `2`: restore the old skip for untranslated draws with persistent targets at once; this can omit writes before the shader is known. Translated memory-writing draws still wait |
| `RX_VK_TRANSLATE_WAIT_MS=<ms>` | Off by default: each shader still translating is waited out, as #1573 does. Set (`8` is the tested value): how long, in all, each recording thread waits in a frame for shaders still translating before leaving their draws on earlier frames' targets out. For first-visit pauses of 0.2-3 s on a cold or changed program bank; a translation slower than the bound can lose a memory write, since its writes are not known before it is translated. A negative value is off; anything but a number is ignored with a warning; the value in use is logged. Compute dispatches still wait their translation out |
| `RX_VK_LOAD=create` or `start` | When programs and their pipelines are loaded from what the preparation kept. Without the switch: `create` where the GPU has mesh shaders, `start` where it draws mesh programs through the compute fallback; and `start` on an install where a session's first uses waited for loads for over 100 ms at once or 500 ms in all, or where the loads found over 500 listed pipelines in no cache (draws left out for pipelines no list names are not counted: they happen in `start` too) (`hookshot_load_start.txt` in the game folder, removed by a preparation or by hand). The first start of the game after a preparation builds every noted pipeline and every kept compute program's pipeline into the pipeline cache once, before the title, and lets each go; the preparation's own process does the same to fill the driver's cache but leaves no marker, since its pipeline cache does not answer the game's process on NVIDIA. With the compressed program cache (`RX_VK_PROGRAM_CACHE_ZSTD=1`) always `start`, whatever this switch says: its records are only read whole. The log says which and why. `start`: every listed one before the title, as before. `create`: none by a list; each program's kept variants and noted pipelines are loaded by a background job when the game makes the program (from the caches only: never a translation or a compile there), and a first draw that comes before its job ran runs it itself. The first start after a preparation builds each noted pipeline into the pipeline cache once and lets it go (before the title, with the precompile's progress), and only then loads at create. `RX_VK_LOAD_WORKERS=<n>` (2): the jobs that run at once (0, to measure: none, a draw loads what it needs itself); `RX_VK_LOAD_UNLISTED=1`: programs no list has a pipeline of are loaded at their create call too (otherwise at their first draw, as with `start`); `RX_VK_LOAD_WORKERS_LOADING=<n>`: while no frame was presented for 100 ms (the same unless set) |
| `RX_VK_MODULE_IDS=0` | Shader module identifiers off (`VK_EXT_shader_module_identifier`). With them a compute program's module is learned by its identifier when it is first made from its code (`hookshot_module_ids.bin`, for one program cache and one driver), and in a later run the load at the program's create call makes that variant's pipeline from the caches without reading its code or making a module; where no cache has the pipeline the code is read as before |
| `RX_VK_PRECOMPILE=0` or `1` | The shader preparation before the title off or on (on in builds made with `RX_RELEASE=1`, as the builders' are) |
| `RX_VK_MESH_SHADERS=native` or `compute` | How task and mesh programs run, read as the device is made (`gpu/vk/mesh_mode.h`; it was the Graphics tab's Mesh shaders row). Unset or any other value: Automatic, the GPU's own mesh shaders where it has them; the compute fallback where it has not, on Linux AMD (RADV, issue 2245), and for the task + mesh draws of the GPUs `RX_VK_TASK_MESH_FALLBACK`'s default names. `native`: the GPU's own for every draw (a GPU without them still gets the fallback). `compute`: the fallback on every GPU. `RX_VK_FORCE_MESH_FALLBACK=1` is `compute` over it. The log's `vk: mesh shaders:` line says which and where it came from. A change translates the programs again, as the program cache's stamp holds the GPU's mesh path (and every `RX_VK_MESH*` switch's text). The old `mesh_shaders=` line in `hookshot_options.ini` is no longer read: the log names it, and the menu's next save drops it |
| `RX_VK_TASK_MESH_FALLBACK=0` or `1` | Task + mesh draws through the compute fallback (1) or the driver's mesh shaders (0). By default the fallback is on for AMD's Navi 21 and Navi 22 on Windows (RX 6800, 6800 XT, 6900 XT, 6950 XT, 6700 XT), where the native path timed out the driver (issue 996) |
| `RX_VK_FALLBACK_LOADED=0` | Where mesh programs are drawn through the compute fallback: the start makes the compute pipelines only of the fallback programs it reads in for that, as before, and not of those read in earlier in the same start (the state lists' programs, in the start that prepares the shaders), whose first draws are then left out until their pipelines are compiled in play |
| `RX_VK_FALLBACK_PHI_LIMIT=<n>` | RADV on GCN 1-4 cards (RX 400/500, R9 2xx/3xx/Fury): a mesh fallback compute stage with more than this many phis is not built and its draws are left out (default 50000; `0`: no limit; anything but decimal digits is ignored with a warning; the limit in use is logged). Its compiler did not finish the two biggest mesh programs (80,000 phis) and grew past 25 GB (`gpu/vk/fallback_size_policy.h`) |
| `RX_VK_DRIVER_FAULTS=0` or `2` | 0: programs the driver's compiler faulted on are asked of it again. By default they are left out for the rest of the run and, through `hookshot_driver_faults.txt` beside the executable, on later runs with the same driver, and on AMD one program's builds go to the driver one at a time (issue 996). 2: one at a time on every driver |
| `RX_VK_GM_LOOP=0` or `1` | The storage buffer tables of a global memory access searched in a loop (1) or written out entry by entry (0). On by default on Intel, whose compiler did not finish the culling programs with the entries written out |
| `RX_VK_IMPORT_CHUNK_MB=<MB>` | The size game memory is imported for the GPU by, and so a pool's VRAM mirror's least size (default 4 where the pools have VRAM mirrors, discrete cards; 16 without them, and before). Larger: fewer imports, more of each mirror outside the game's pools |
| `RX_VK_NO_PROGRAM_CACHE` (set) | Neither reads nor writes `hookshot_programs.bin` and the pipeline notes |
| `RX_VK_PCACHE_STAMP=0` | Keeps `mkw_vk_pipelines.bin` and its play files whatever translator made them. By default they are dropped at a start when `mkw_vk_pipelines.stamp` says another translator made them (as the program cache starts over), since their pipelines can no longer be hit |
| `RX_VK_FETCH_BOUNDS=0` or `1`, `RX_VK_NAN_BITS=0` or `1`, `RX_VK_GATHER_OFFSET=0` or `1` | The translation's vendor and driver workarounds (`gpu/vk/vk_vendor.h`) off or on for one run, whatever the GPU; the log's `vk: vendor fixes` line says which are on. By default: out-of-bounds texel fetches answered with 0 on every GPU but NVIDIA's; NaN tests on a value's bits on AMD's older Windows shader compiler (RX 5000 and RX 6000); gathers nudged by 1/512 of a texel on AMD's and Intel's drivers. They change the shaders' translation (one preparation of the shaders) |
| `RX_VK_NATIVE_FADD=0` or `1` | The shaders' float adds to storage buffers: 1 the GPU's own atomic where it has `VK_EXT_shader_atomic_float`'s `shaderBufferFloat32AtomicAdd`, 0 a compare-exchange loop on every GPU, the extension not enabled. By default the GPU's own on NVIDIA's driver only, the one it was tried on in the game; on AMD and Intel the loop until runs there show the native add works (the log's `vk: float atomic add on storage buffers:` line says which, and why). The loop gives up after 1024 attempts, and an add that gives up is lost |
| `RX_VK_UB_WORD_HASH=0` | A/B test: use the old low-address-bit index for cached uniform words (default: mix upper address bits to reduce aligned-buffer collisions) |
| `RX_VK_MIRROR=0`, `RX_VK_MIRROR_MB=<MB>` | No VRAM mirrors of the game's memory pools (on for discrete cards); their budget |
| `RX_VK_MIRROR_TRIM=0` | An import whose mirror is mostly outside every game pool is no longer made again smaller (it is while VRAM is over 80% full: the previous scene's large pools otherwise keep their mirrors for the session; `gpu/vk/mirror_trim.h`) |
| `RX_VK_CAPTURE_KEEP_OLD=1`, `RX_VK_CAP_BLOCKS=1` | A/B switches for capture buffers: keep the former size classes and 64 MB reuse limit; allocate large buffers from shared blocks instead of dedicated memory. Both are off by default and follow the on/off rule above, including `0`, `false`, `off` and `no` |
| `RX_VK_VRAM_MB=<MB>` | The texture cache's budget in MiB, over a preset's and over the default (70% of what the driver allows the process, 45% where that is 8.5 GB or less, at most 6 GB; on an integrated GPU less, by the system's RAM: 1 GB with 8 GB of RAM, 2 GB with 12, 2.5 GB with 16, 3.5 GB with 24, 4 GB with 32, and up to 6 GB above that). What a texture counts: BC and natively sampled ASTC by whole blocks at each mip level, partial blocks included; decoded ASTC by its output format; and never less than the allocator's size (`RX_VK_COUNT_BY_ESTIMATE=1`: the estimate alone). The log prints these MiB as `MB` |
| `RX_VK_MIN_WORKING_SET_MB=<MB>` | Windows: the least of the game's memory the system is asked to keep in RAM (`SetProcessWorkingSetSizeEx`, a hard minimum, a soft one if refused; logged as `vk: working set:`), asked at start-up and again by the menu's Refresh memory. Default a third of the RAM, at most 10 GB (about 2.7 GB with 8 GB of RAM). `0`: not asked. A PC with little RAM may want `0` or a lower value, or Windows has less to give other programs |
| `RX_VK_AUTO_PRESET=0`, `RX_VK_AUTO_PRESET_VRAM_MB=<MB>` | A first start keeps the defaults instead of starting on the Quality preset Auto (this PC) (`gpu/vk/auto_settings.h`); the card's video memory taken as that many MB, to see what Auto chooses for a smaller or larger card |
| `RX_VK_AUTO_TUNE=0` | Auto (this PC) keeps its Render resolution instead of measuring the GPU in play and stepping it: down while frames are missed with the GPU over 90% busy, up while the cap holds with it under half busy (`auto_settings.h` `tune`) |
| `RX_VK_COMPACT=0`, `RX_VK_COMPACT_PCT=<50..90>`, `RX_VK_COMPACT_MB=<MB>` | VRAM compaction (on by default; `=0` turns it off): the textures that are not render targets in a pool of their own, moved out of sparsely used blocks a few a present so that the blocks go back to the driver, and the texture budget holding the driver's count at that share of what it allows (85) by letting go of the render targets drawn over since and of textures unused for ten seconds, with a reserve five points under it (80) where those unused for thirty seconds go (what the budget's size, the 90% rule and the driver's limit ask for on their own still goes from textures unused for a second, as with it off); the free space that starts a run (512; 192 while the count is over 90%) |
| `RX_VK_EVICT_EXCESS=0` | The 90% rule and the driver's limit cut the texture cache to 7/8 of their budget again, as before; by default they let go of their excess and 64 MB more (`vram_compact::rule_target`), so a cache a few MB over the line does not lose an eighth of its textures |
| `RX_VK_REACTIVE=1`, `RX_VK_REACTIVE_SCALE=<0..64>`, `RX_VK_REACTIVE_MAX=<0..1>`, `RX_VK_REACTIVE_DEBUG=1` | A reactive mask for DLSS and FSR 3.1 only, not FSR 4 (`gpu/vk/vk_reactive.h`, off by default: not yet checked in the game): the scene's colour is copied before its blended draws that test depth without writing it (water, smoke, fire, glows), and where the scene differs from the copy at the upscale the upscaler leans on the current frame, so they smear and ghost less. The mask is the difference times the scale (1), at most the maximum (0.9); the debug switch shows it in the picture in magenta. The mask is the whole difference since the copy, so a blended draw after the last transparent run (a full-screen fade) is in it too. The log's `vk: reactive mask:` lines say whether one is made |
| `RX_VK_NO_DRAWN_WRITEBACK=1` | Small mip-chained textures the GPU drew are not written into guest memory a few frames later (where that memory is still zero, or still their own last write-back), as before: Ocarina of Time's ground garbles after some minutes in one area (its copies of drawn terrain tiles are all zero) |
| `RX_VK_SKIP_COMPRESSED_OVER_RT=1` | A compressed (ASTC, BC, ETC2/EAC) texture made over storage render targets used is not uploaded, as before: bosses and new enemies all blue the first time |
| `RX_VK_NO_WRITEBACK` (set) | GPU writes to mirrored pools are not copied back to guest memory (an experiment, for A/B) |
| `RX_VK_WB_DIFF=0` | Write-backs copy every byte again instead of only what changed against a VRAM shadow (the diff is on by default; v2.0.9 and v2.0.10 had it off, issue 1161) |
| `RX_VK_WB_OBSERVE=1` | Opt-in diagnostics for actual mirror/shadow differences in the write-back diff pass. Reports completed chunks and bytes covered by changed chunks every 600 submissions; does not change copy decisions. See [write-back observations](writeback-observations.md) for interpretation and tests |
| `RX_VK_DLSS=0/1/2`, `RX_VK_DLSS_PRESET=<letter>`, `RX_VK_DLSS_LOG=1`, `RX_VK_REFLEX`, `RX_VK_REFLEX_LOG=1`, `RX_VK_REFLEX_SUBMIT_IDS=0`, `RX_VK_ANTILAG=0/1` | NVIDIA DLSS and Reflex, and AMD Anti-Lag 2, for one run (`=-` on Reflex or Anti-Lag 2: its extensions not even enabled): the readme's NVIDIA DLSS section. `RX_VK_DLSS_TRACE=<frames>` logs one frame's large draws every that many frames, `RX_VK_DLSS_DEBUG=motion` shows the motion vectors, `=alternate` the game's own upscale every other frame. `RX_VK_DLSS_HDR=0` keeps DLSS's LDR feature and clamped colour with Native HDR too, for comparisons. `RX_VK_REFLEX_SUBMIT_IDS=0` sends the queue submits without their game frame (`VkLatencySubmissionPresentIdNV`, `gpu/vk/vk_reflex.cpp`), for comparisons: with frame generation, Reflex's "to the GPU's end" timing then goes wrong by hundreds of ms |
| `RX_VK_FSR4=0/1/2`, `RX_VK_FSR_DIR=<folder>`, `RX_VK_FSR4_HDR=0` | AMD FSR 4 for one run (0 never, 1 FSR 4, 2 its Native AA), and another folder for AMD's DLLs (not from `hookshot_env.txt`): the readme's AMD FSR 4 section. `RX_VK_FSR4=1/2` and `RX_VK_DLSS=1/2` go over the Upscaler row, a saved FSR 3.1 too where the engine they ask for runs; `RX_VK_FSR=1` goes over them (one upscaler at a time). The DLSS trace and debug switches above (and `RX_VK_DLSS_JITTER=0`) apply to FSR 4 too, and to FSR 3.1 on the chain, on the frame chain they share. `RX_VK_FSR4_HDR=0`: with HDR on Native, FSR 4 keeps its LDR context and the colour clamped at the paper white, as before (by default it takes the game's HDR colour as linear light while the game presents PQ). `RX_VK_FSR4_TUNE=0`: AMD's passes as AMD made them; by default, on AMD GPUs, the network's layers run 64 lanes wide, the weight tables the layers and the postpass copy into per-thread arrays are read from a tail of the library's storage buffer, and the small layers with weight tables are unrolled, built one at a time in the background (`gpu/vk/fsr4_tune.h`, `vk_fsr4.cpp`); checked bit for bit against AMD's output on an RX 6700 XT with Adrenalin 26.10.1 (other drivers: the same maths, not necessarily the same bits). Where the library binds its buffer without the tail, or destroys it, AMD's own shaders are bound for that context and the log says so (`AMD's own shaders in place of the tuned ones`). `RX_VK_FSR4_UNROLL=0`: all of that but the unrolling |
| `RX_VK_FSR3_CHAIN=0` | AMD FSR 3.1 upscales with inputs of its own (`vk_fsr3_inputs.cpp`: the camera's motion alone) instead of as an engine of `vk_temporal.cpp`'s chain (the skinned draws' own motion, as DLSS and FSR 4 get it), for comparisons. The log says `vk: fsr3 on the chain: N frames drawn` on the chain, `vk: fsr3 ... with assembled depth and camera motion` without |
| `RX_VK_ASYNC=1` | The replay on a thread of its own instead of the game's submitting thread |
| `RX_VK_DESC_REUSE=0/1/never` | Over the Descriptor reuse row for a run, with its values: 0 its Off (a draw keeps the descriptors of the draw before it while no registration at all was made), 1 its On (through registrations of slots it does not sample, the default); `never`: every draw builds its own |
| `RX_VK_NAN_GUARD=0` | No NaN guard on float colour outputs (on by default on every card: one NaN texel spreads through bloom into glowing blocks) |
| `RX_VK_FIFO=1`, `RX_VK_IMMEDIATE=1` | V-Sync On (FIFO) or Off (immediate) for one run, over the menu's V-Sync row |
| `HOS_VCORES=0`, `HOS_CORES=<1..8>`, `HOS_RESERVE_CORE=0` | No virtual cores; the cores the game sees (6); no core kept for the replay (one is, with 8 or more logical processors) |

### Building

A build reads and writes tens of gigabytes. When the game folder or the build files folder is on a hard drive,
`make_game.py` warns that an SSD is much faster and builds anyway (the builders ask before they start).

| Switch | What it does |
|---|---|
| `HOOKSHOT_JOBS=<n>` (or `--jobs`) | Compilers at once (default one per CPU thread, each started when the free memory holds it; `HOOKSHOT_MEM_GATE=0` turns that check off) |
| `HOOKSHOT_LIFT_JOBS=<n>` | Processes that write the lifted C and make its edits (default the cores, at most 16, one per 2 GB free) |
| `HOOKSHOT_KEEP_BUILD_FILES=1` | Keeps the lifted C and the objects after a build, so that the next one compiles only what changed |
| `HOOKSHOT_FORCE_PROMPTS=1` | Regenerates button-prompt assets even when unchanged. Unset, empty, `0`, `false`, `off` and `no` (case-insensitive, surrounding spaces ignored) are off |
| `HOOKSHOT_MINGW=<dir>`, `HOOKSHOT_MSVC=1` | The llvm-mingw to build with; the Visual Studio route instead |
| `RX_CPM=<dir>`, `WGPU_NATIVE=<dir>` | The CPM cache (Vulkan and SPIR-V headers, VMA, FFmpeg) and wgpu-native |
| `RX_TARGET=windows` | On Linux: the Windows game, with llvm-mingw's Linux build in `HOOKSHOT_MINGW` |
| `RX_RELEASE=1` | A release build (`make_game.py` sets it): no console window, the shaders prepared before the title |
| `RX_PGO=gen` or `RX_PGO=<file>` | The hot code counting its branches for a profile, or built with one (`make_game.py` passes the shipped profile) |
| `RX_HOT_OPT=<level>` | The hot pieces' optimisation level (default `O2`); `O1` for [a faster build for development](#a-faster-build-for-development) |
| `RX_MARCH=<level>` | The CPU level to build for (default this PC's: `x86-64-v3`, else `x86-64-v2`, else `x86-64`) |
| `RX_VK_ONLY=1` | Only the Vulkan back end, with no lift |
| `OOT_WORK`, `OOT_DUMP`, `OOT_EXEFS`, `OOT_ROMFS` | The work folder and the dump's folders, over `work/dump.txt` |

Source-checkout builds keep the button prompts when their source, fonts, game assets, button tables, image overrides,
Python, package/library versions and generation options still match, and every generated file still has its recorded
size and content hash. The inputs are checked before and after generation; changed or unreadable inputs leave no reusable
stamp. The log says `prompts: unchanged, kept` or why it regenerated. Packaged builders (the finish stage's launcher
path) still regenerate every time; `RX_RELEASE` does not distinguish them from source builds. Generation uses a fresh
directory and publishes only a complete set. A failed generator still removes the prompts, so the game shows its own
icons, as before. An interrupted builder can leave the old set without a stamp; the next build regenerates it.
The files the game derives at run time are still cleared by every build, including a cache hit; they are not part of
the stamp. If those files cannot be cleared, the build regenerates rather than trusting them.
Before checking the cache, builds sweep `.prompts-*` staging directories without following links or Windows reparse
points. POSIX uses checked directory descriptors and owner locks, with a 24-hour grace period for unmarked legacy
directories; it skips cleanup if descriptor-safe removal is unavailable. Windows uses only the 24-hour age rule,
even for directories with an owner marker, and never opens a leftover's owner file or compares file identities.
Removal is best effort: a locked, in-use or otherwise unremovable directory is kept with a message, without failing
the build.

#### A faster build for development

The eight hot pieces (`code_hot_*.c`, the functions the game spends its time in) are built at `-O2` with the play
profile, their hot callees inlined. They are 81 MB of the 1.4 GB of lifted C but about a third of its compile time,
and each is one of the longest single compiles, so a build after a new lift cannot end before the slowest of them.
When you are checking that something works (the game starts, a menu, a screenshot, a log) and not how fast it runs,
build them as every other lifted file is built, at `-O1` and without the profile:

```
RX_HOT_OPT=O1 python -I nx2/build.py --standalone --jobs 8
```

`build.py` run on its own uses no profile unless `RX_PGO` is set. `make_game.py` always passes the shipped profile
(`work/hookshot_pieces.prof`), so `RX_HOT_OPT=O1` through `make_game.py` gives `-O1` with the profile, which saves less.
Run on its own, `build.py` also lacks the rest of `make_game.py`'s environment (`RX_RELEASE`, `A64_HOT_CHUNK`), so its
runtime objects differ from a `make_game.py` build's.

The objects are cached by their flags, so `-O1` and `-O2` objects can sit side by side, and `make_game.py` leaves
`RX_HOT_OPT` and `RX_PGO` out of its lift key. In the checkout's own `work/` folder, or with
`HOOKSHOT_KEEP_BUILD_FILES=1`, switching back and forth therefore neither translates the game again nor recompiles
anything built before. In any other `--work` folder, `make_game.py`'s clean-up keeps only the last build's objects and a
translation that fits them, so each switch translates the game again and recompiles the hot pieces.

What it saves, from the per-file compile times (`build_times.json`) of six earlier full builds on one 24-thread
desktop, with other work running (not a measured `-O1` build):

| | Hot pieces (`-O2`, profile) | The 72 other lifted files (`-O1`) |
|---|---|---|
| Compile time, all of them | 1,270-1,810 s | 2,820-3,750 s |
| Per MB of C | 16-22 s | 2.2-2.9 s |
| Longest single file | 300-800 s | ~360 s (`code_021_1.c`, giant functions) |
| Peak memory per compiler | 0.8-1.7 GB | 1.4-1.6 GB for a 24 MB file |

At the other files' rate the hot pieces should take about 200 s instead of about 1,500 s of compile time, about
a quarter less in all, and the build's longest file becomes an ordinary one, so a build after a new lift can end several
minutes sooner on a CPU with many threads. The peak memory hardly changes: the ordinary files set it already.
The hot code runs slower at `-O1`; the game still plays (the profile-counting build, `RX_PGO=gen`, already builds
the hot pieces at `-O1` and is played through to record the profile), but check that the frame rate is good enough for
what you test.

**Never use it for numbers:** no fps or frame-time measurements, build timings, hitch or stutter checks, profiles,
and no release or player build. Build those with the defaults.

## The pipeline state list

Every release ships a list of pipelines, merged from the sources in `assets/pipeline_states/`:

- `tour.bin.xz`, which only the pipeline tour (`scripts/pipeline_tour.py`) writes, replaced whole each time;
- `contrib/<name>.bin.xz`, one per contributed list, which people add.

Each has a note beside it (`<name>.md`) that says who recorded it, on what GPU, driver, build and settings, and the
route. [`assets/pipeline_states/README.md`](../assets/pipeline_states/README.md) has how to record and add a list. Each
record is a pipeline the game asked for: its shaders' hashes, the program variant's hash, and the target formats,
vertex formats and draw state it was made with (`nx2/pipeline_states.py` has the layout). It holds no game code: a
player's build turns the hashes back into shaders from their own `hookshot_shaders.bin`.

A record can also name a compute program the game ran, by the hash of its shader alone (the record's kind says which;
the file format is the same, and lists from before read as they did). The game writes one the first time a run
dispatches a program. Every start keeps the pipelines of the listed compute programs ready before the title: the
shipped list's, and the ones in the game folder's `hookshot_computes.bin`, which holds what this install's play has
dispatched (the same programs its own state list names). Without a list entry, a program is loaded and its pipeline
made at its first dispatch, and a dispatch whose pipeline takes more than 50 ms is skipped. The log's
`precompile: compute programs` and `compute pipelines` lines say how many were listed, from where, and how many
pipelines came from the caches or were compiled. A first start, before this install's play has dispatched anything,
keeps every compute program the game has, as it did before the list named any: a program the list misses is then ready
too, at the cost of that start's memory. `RX_VK_PRECOMPILE_COMPUTES=listed` keeps only the listed ones on a first
start as well; `learned` leaves the shipped list's out, to compare; `all` keeps every one at every start and `none`
keeps none. The game keeps every compute program a shipped list names and never drops one: the bound is
`pipeline_states.py check`, which stops on a merged list that names more than `COMPUTE_MOST`, for someone to decide.

`nx2/make_game.py` merges the sources at every build into the game folder's `hookshot_pipeline_states_shipped.bin`. It
takes the tour's list first, then the contributed ones by name, and keeps each pipeline once. The same sources always
give the same bytes, and the first start's shader preparation builds those pipelines before the title. Without them a
new install builds them in play, and draws left out while they compile wash the first field load white for seconds
(v2.0.8 to v2.0.14 shipped none). The sources are xz-compressed, written with fixed settings, so that the repository's
history stays small. The current ones hold 11527 pipelines in about 175 KB.

Every release carries them:

- the AppImage with `assets/`: `scripts/linux/appimage.sh` stops without them, and `scripts/linux/check_player_build.sh`
  checks them with the image's Python;
- the Windows builder's `tools/assets/pipeline_states`: `scripts/release_parts.py package` stops when there are none or
  one does not read.

xz rather than zstd: the AppImage's Python is 3.12, whose standard library has `lzma` but not `compression.zstd`.

A game run writes `hookshot_pipeline_states.bin` beside the executable, adding each pipeline it makes in play. To add a
list, play on a build of the current source and add that file as a contributed list. `add` keeps only the pipelines no
other contributed list holds:

```sh
python -I nx2/pipeline_states.py add <name> <game folder>/hookshot_pipeline_states.bin --who ... --gpu ... --build ... --settings ... --route ...
python -I nx2/pipeline_states.py tour <tour lists>... --gpu ... --build ... --settings ... --route ...   # the tour's, replaced
python -I nx2/pipeline_states.py check                      # every source, and the merge, as CI and the release checks read them
python -I nx2/pipeline_states.py merge --out merged.bin     # the list make_game writes beside the game
```

A list depends on the settings it was recorded with: its records hold the target formats and draw state, so one recorded
at 1440p with DLSS shares few pipelines with one recorded at 360p.

Players send theirs to issue #2034 with **Save my pipeline list** (the menu's Debug tab, under Developer: `gpu/vk/pipeline_share.h` and
`vk_menu.cpp` `share_pipeline_list`; the builders: `nx2/pipeline_share.py`, which the Linux builder imports and the Windows
one runs with `--json`). It checks the list as `pipeline_states.py --check` does and writes
`hookshot-pipelines-<date>.zip` to the Downloads folder with exactly two files, the list and `hookshot_pipeline_report.txt`
(the issue's template filled in from the run or from the game folder's log and `hookshot_options.ini`), then copies the
template, shows the folder and opens the issue; never with `HOS_HEADLESS`. The list is zipped as the game wrote it, compute
records included (the report's `Pipelines` line counts them); `pipeline_states.py --check` and `add` take a sent list only
when it is exactly a list (`read_sent`). `tests/test_pipeline_share.py` checks the zip,
the template and the refusals for both. By hand: `python -I nx2/pipeline_share.py <game folder> [--out-dir <folder>]`.

Refresh the tour's list before each release, and after a change to the shaders' translation or to the state a pipeline
is made from. A record that no longer matches what play asks for builds a pipeline nothing uses, and the one play wants
compiles in play. When the record's format changes (its magic and record size, `MAGIC` and `SIZE` in
`nx2/pipeline_states.py`), the old lists no longer read and the release checks stop. Convert each source in place, or
record it again, and make a new tour list. The folder's layout stays the same.

## The options file

A new row on the Graphics, Audio, Gameplay or Controls tab needs a line in the README's option table too, in the
menu's order, with its choices and default: `tests/test_readme_menu_rows.py` fails without it.

`hookshot_options.ini`, in the game folder, holds the Insert menu's rows as `<key>=<number>`: the row's name in lower
case with `_` for spaces (`frame_generation=2`, `invert_camera_x=1`), except Output resolution, which is `output_res`.
`gpu/vk/vk_menu.cpp` writes the whole file at every change (`save`), with `options_version=5`,
`microphone_device=<name>` when a microphone is chosen by name, and the controls (`pad_<button>` and `key_<button>`:
the README's [Controls](../readme.md#controls)). A value outside a row's range is clamped when it is read. Where the
number is not the obvious one:

| Key | Values |
|---|---|
| `quality_preset` | 0 Custom, 1 Minimum (4GB), 2 Low (6GB), 3 Balanced (8GB), 4 High (12GB), 5 Ultra (16GB+) |
| `gpu_device` | 0 Auto, n the n-th card with Vulkan 1.3 as the row lists them |
| `frame_generation` | 0 Off, 2 to 8 the multiplier |
| `resolution` | 0 Auto, 1 100%, 2 75%, 3 67%, 4 50% |
| `output_res` | A size, `<width>x<height>`: 2048x1152 (the game's own), one of the screen's display modes (the menu's Aspect ratio and Output resolution rows), or any other with each side a multiple of 8 (rounded down), at least 640x360, at most 5120x2880's pixels, 5:4 to 48:9; anything else is the game's own. A size more than 1 % off 16:9 sets the picture's shape (`host/hos_wide_size.h` `hos_output_own_shape`). The Aspect ratio row saves `ultrawide=` 1 for the monitor's own shape, else 0; another shape is `output_res`'s own. The numbers saved before (0 2048x1152, 1 2560x1440, 2 3840x2160, 3 1920x1080, 4 5120x1440, 5 5120x2880) are still read |
| `upscaling` | 0 Off, 1 Catmull-Rom, 2 Lanczos |
| `sharpness`, `rumble_strength`, `motion_sensitivity_x`, `motion_sensitivity_y` | percent |
| `mouse_sensitivity` | hundredths: 100 is 1.00 |
| `field_of_view` | 50 to 150 percent of the current vertical gameplay FOV; 100 is the original. Applies immediately, before projection and culling. The resulting vertical angle stays within 5 to 140 degrees |
| `robust_buffers` | 0 Auto (on), 1 Off, 2 On |
| `game_speed` | 0 Per frame, 1 Real time |
| `text_speed` | 0 Normal, 1 2x, 2 4x, 3 Instant |
| `microphone` | 0 Off, 1 Default, 2 and up a microphone (the name in `microphone_device` decides which) |
| `mouse_camera` | 0 As the stick, 1 Native |
| `layout_preset` | 0 Nintendo, 1 Xbox / PC, 2 Swap Face, 3 Custom |

The other rows are 0 Off and 1 On. Some are read at the start, before the menu exists, by the code that needs them:
`handheld_profile` and `output_res` (`host/nn_applet.c`), `ultrawide` (`host/hos_main.c`), `robust_buffers`
(`gpu/vk/vk_main.cpp`) and the controls (`host/nn_hid.c`).

`HOS_CONTROL=<socket path>` turns on the control bridge: a local socket a tool or coding agent drives the running game
through (inputs timed in frames, screenshots, waits for the game's state, the Insert menu's settings, quit), with
`scripts/hookshot_ctl.py` as its client. Off unless set; see [control.md](control.md).
